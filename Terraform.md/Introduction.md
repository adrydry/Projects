## What is Terraform?
   Known as an Iac, **Terraform** is a provisioning tool, created by Harchicop, that help us to **automate and manage the platform and the services of this platform** where our infrstructure will be deployed. We have many IAC but Terraform is mostly used because it can run on many cloud providers platform through the API;
   Terraform can be used also to **manage all the changes** because in real world, after creating our infrastructure for our project, we will continue and we will need to adjust or change things and instead of doing that manually, Terraform will be very helpful. The changes can be: Add the number of servers, of containers, change the services, deploy more microservices, add some security configurations or remove something, etc...;
Terraform can also be used to **replicate our infrastructure**

**2- Providers for specific Technologies:
